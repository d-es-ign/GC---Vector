### 3b. Including SVG

SVGs can be used in HTML/JSX in the same way as other types of images:

`<img src="/path/to/image.svg" alt="SVG as an image">`

As well as in CSS (and its pre-processors) as a background image:

```figure {
  background-image: url("/path/to/image.svg");
}
```


Pros:

Simple
Cons:

SVG can't be customized
